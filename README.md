# QAL Lite

**QAL Lite 0.9.2** is the publicly-available, free, and lightweight version of QAL 0.9.2.

**QAL** (Quantum Algorithms Lab) is an innovative visual interactive web app for *teaching* and *researching* quantum algorithms and quantum informatics, as well as related mathematical fields such as linear algebra and group theory.

**QAL Lite** presents a glimpse of the main features of QAL. Check the `QAL-Abstract` and `QAL Lite-Screenshots` files in [QAL Docs](./doc/) for more details.

As to teaching math in particular, QAL aims to teach the concepts of linear algebra and group theory visually and interactively as an intuitive mathematical *game*. (For more on this, check the QAL GPP `QAL GameMode` in [QAL Docs](./doc/)).

Besides quantum computing, the math nicely presented in QAL has applications in machine learning and AI, computer graphics, cybersecurity, and many other mathematical sciences.

QAL Lite is currently hosted on GitHub, and is hosted and accessible also from [here](http://eng.staff.alexu.edu.eg/staff/moez/QAL/Lite).
